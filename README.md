# PKMNSprites
Scrapes and downloads sprites of Pokemon from PokemonShowdown's archives.
This is a personal exercise to test my skill in Python, HTML scraping, XML, and RegEx.

Before running the .py file, you must create the directory for the sprites to be stored correctly.
To do this, I have provided a .zip file (it is blank). 
Unzip this in the same directory as Downloader and indices before running the program, or it will not work!
